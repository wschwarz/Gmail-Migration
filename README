Description
  During the summer of 2009 the UCLA School of Law acquired a Google Apps account and decided
to use Google to host email services for the law school. In order to implement this without
interfering with current students, staff and faculty email usage a migration tool was 
requested. This tool would migrate all necessary and data from the old Imail system into
G-mail using the Google Apps API.
   
All Migrations completed Fall 2009.

Disclaimer: Google APIs may have changed since the creation of this application.
